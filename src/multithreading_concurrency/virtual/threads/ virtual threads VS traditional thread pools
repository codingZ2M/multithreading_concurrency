Can virtual threads completely replace traditional thread pools like Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int)?
======================================================================================================

In most modern I/O-bound or concurrent Java applications, virtual threads can completely replace traditional
thread pools like newFixedThreadPool(), provided you're using Java 21+.

üß† Let's break it down:
üßµ 1. Traditional Thread Pools (newFixedThreadPool())
		Use platform (OS) threads.
		Thread creation is expensive (heap, kernel resources).
		You limit the number of threads (e.g., 100 threads) to avoid resource exhaustion.
		Works well for CPU-bound or limited concurrency scenarios.
		

ü™∂ 2. Virtual Threads (Thread.startVirtualThread() or newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
			Use JVM-scheduled threads, not tied to OS threads.
			Thread creation is extremely cheap (millions possible).
			Ideal for high-concurrency I/O-bound tasks (e.g., handling 10K+ requests).
			You don't usually need to cap or manage them ‚Äî the JVM handles the scheduling.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

‚úÖ Conclusion
You can completely replace traditional fixed thread pools with virtual threads in most modern I/O-bound
applications. But for CPU-bound tasks or controlled concurrency, traditional pools still have a valid use.

If you're building a web server, async API client, or data-processing pipeline, switching to virtual 
threads is almost always a win.
