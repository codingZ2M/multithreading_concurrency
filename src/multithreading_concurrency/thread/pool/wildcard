✅ What is Future<?>?
=====================
Future<?> future = executor.submit(() -> doSomething());

🔍 The parts:
Future<T> is a generic interface that represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
<?> is a wildcard — it means "unknown type".

🧠 What Does <?> Mean?
========================
<?> = "I don’t know (or care) what the actual type is."
It tells the compiler:
“This is a Future of some type, but I’m not going to use that value in a type-specific way.”

🔸 Why Use <?>?
==============
Because sometimes the task you submit returns nothing (i.e., Runnable) — so you don’t care about the return type:

Future<?> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello from Runnable");
});

Since Runnable doesn't return a result (void), the actual return type is Future<?>
You just use the future to wait for completion, not get a result.

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Future<?>`      | Future of an unknown type (wildcard)      |
| `Future<String>` | Future that will return a String          |
| `<?>`            | "Some type, but we don’t care what it is" |
