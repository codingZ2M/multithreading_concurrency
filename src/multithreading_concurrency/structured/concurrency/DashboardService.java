  âœ… Purpose:The core service that builds the final UserDashboard by concurrently:
  		Fetching user profile (UserClient)
		Fetching user activity (ActivityClient)
		Fetching recommendations (RecsServiceA and RecsServiceB)
		
		ðŸ§  Key Benefits of Structured Concurrency Here:
				All 4 subtasks (2 recommendations, 1 profile, 1 activity) are launched in parallel.
				If any task fails, the scope shuts down the rest		
				It ensures all results are ready before constructing the dashboard.
