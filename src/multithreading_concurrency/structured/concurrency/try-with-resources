✅ What does try (...) {} mean in Java?
This is a try-with-resources statement.

☑️ Purpose:
It’s used to ensure that a resource (like a file, DB connection, or in this case: a task scope) is 
automatically closed when the block ends — even if an exception occurs.

🔐 Requirements:
The object inside try (...) must implement AutoCloseable — which StructuredTaskScope does!



🧠 Why do we use it with StructuredTaskScope?
===============================================
Here's what happens:
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    ...
}

✅ A new scope (ShutdownOnFailure) is created.
✅ Tasks are forked (submitted) within the scope.
✅ When the block ends:
	If everything succeeded: the scope exits cleanly.
	If anything failed: the scope automatically cancels remaining tasks.
✅ The scope is closed automatically — no manual cleanup required.
✅ Auto-close: Scope shuts down automatically when the block exits

This protects against:
	Thread leaks
	Dangling tasks
	Uncaught exceptions
